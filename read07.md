# Functions:
## Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

## Function declarations
## A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

## The name of the function.
## A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
## The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}
## Function expressions
## While the function declaration above is syntactically a statement, functions can also be created by a function expression.
## Calling functions
## Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called.

## Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters. For example, if you define the function square, you could call it as follows
# Function scope :
## Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function, because the variable is defined only in the scope of the function. However, a function can access all variables and functions defined inside the scope in which it is defined.

# In other words, a function defined in the global scope can access all variables defined in the global scope. A function defined inside another function can also access all variables defined in its parent function, and any other variables to which the parent function has access.
# Expressions and operators:
## This chapter describes JavaScript's expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary and more.
# Operators
## JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence. 
# Assignment operators
## An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.
